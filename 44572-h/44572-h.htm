<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The best preface to <i>this</i> set of the <span class="smcap">Points of Humour</span>
is the <i>former</i> set, which, we are credibly informed,
has favorably disposed the muscles of our readers for
repeating a certain cackling sound, which is heart-food
to our friend George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>One individual, for certain, has laughed over these
<span class="smcap">Points</span>, and he is a very worthy gentleman, who may
be discerned wedging his way through sundry piles of
books in a remarkable part of Newgate-street, being
opposite to the huge prison of that name. No one ever
asked him after the sale of this little work, without observing
an instantaneous distension of that feature of
the face which is used for more purposes than merely
grinning. It is to be devoutly hoped that this second
set will not spoil his merriment, and that, as rather a
coarse saying goes, "he will not be made to sing to
another tune."</p>

<p>The author, collector, compiler, editor, writer, or
whatever name the daily or weekly critics may give
him, for they have given him all these, will, undoubtedly,
be heartily sorry should this change take place,
for he avows that since the publication of the <span class="smcap">Points</span>,
the face of the worthy gentleman alluded to has been
illuminated by one unclouded sunshine, so much so, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
that to enter his shop has been a constant resource
against melancholy during this gloomy weather. A
face lighted up with good humour in a dark shop, is
like a blaze of light in the middle of one of Rembrandt's
murky pictures.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the compiler has taken a hint, or
rather <i>followed</i> a hint of one of the critics upon this
little book. He has resorted for part of his materials,
to the author, who is the richest of all in the humour of
<i>situation</i>. Fielding has been suggested; but though
some things, excellent in their kind, might be found
in him, yet it will be observed, on a more accurate consideration,
that this admirable author is infinitely less
adapted to the pencil of Cruikshank, than his successor
in the walk of humour. Fielding is a master in the
power of laying open all the springs which regulate the
motion of that curious piece of mechanism, the human
heart. He wrote with the inspiration of genius, and is
true to nature in her minutest circumstances. He involuntarily
and unconsciously catches the look, the
word, the gesture, which would undoubtedly have manifested
itself, and which is in itself a strong gleam of
light upon the whole character. His <i>dramatis personæ</i>
are not, generally, very extraordinary people.&mdash;He dealt
in that which is <i>common</i> to all. While, on the contrary,
Smollett is rich in that which is uncommon and eccentric.
His field is among oddities, hobby-horses, foibles,
and singularities of all kinds, which he groups in the
most extraordinary manner, and colours for the most
striking effect. We read Fielding with a satisfied smile,
but it is over the page of Smollett that the loud laugh
is heard to break forth.&mdash;How much at home our artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
is in the conception of Smollett may be seen in the
following plates.</p>

<p>It has been said that it is a pity Mr. Cruikshank
should waste his talents upon ephemeral anecdotes, and
not hand down his name by illustrating the works of
our great Novelists. As well might it have been said
to these great Novelists, "confine yourselves to commenting
upon, or translating Cervantes or Le Sage."
Genius consecrates and immortalizes all it touches.&mdash;If
the tales or anecdotes be ephemeral, the plates will
stamp them for a good old age. Hogarth did not paint
his <i>Rake's Progress</i> in illustration of any immortal
work, nor does it require a set of octavo volumes to remind
posterity of his existence.</p>

<p>A similar excuse may apply to Cruikshank, who, generally,
would chuse rather to exalt the humble, than
endow the rich.</p>

<p>We have an observation to make respecting one of
the plates, the last in the order. It will be seen that
the costume of the characters there pourtrayed, is essentially
different from that adopted by every illustrator
of Shakspeare. This has not been done unadvisedly.
The proper authorities have been in this, as in other
cases, diligently consulted, and it has appeared that
these artists, in their endeavour to discover the dress of
our ancestors, have stopped short at the reign of
Charles II., instead of penetrating to that of Henry V.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_I" id="POINT_I">POINT I.</a></h2>

<h3>THE THREE HUNCHBACKS.</h3>


<p>At a short distance from Douai, there stood a castle
on the bank of a river near a bridge. The master of
this castle was hunchbacked. Nature had exhausted
her ingenuity in the formation of his whimsical figure.
In place of understanding, she had given him an immense
head, which nevertheless was lost between his
two shoulders: he had thick hair, a short neck, and a
horrible visage.</p>

<p>Spite of his deformity, this bugbear bethought himself
of falling in love with a beautiful young woman,
the daughter of a poor but respectable burgess of
Douai. He sought her in marriage, and as he was
the richest person in the district, the poor girl was
delivered up to him. After the nuptials he was as
much an object of pity as she, for, being devoured
by jealousy, he had no tranquillity night nor day, but
went prying and rambling every where, and suffered
no stranger to enter the castle.</p>

<p>One day during the Christmas festival, while standing
sentinel at his gate, he was accosted by three
humpbacked minstrels. They saluted him as a brother,
as such asked him for refreshments, and at the
same time, to establish the fraternity, they ostentatiously
shouldered their humps at him. Contrary to
expectation, he conducted them to his kitchen, gave
them a capon with peas, and to each a piece of money
over and above. Before their departure, however, he
warned them never to return on pain of being thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
into the river. At this threat of the Chatelain the
minstrels laughed heartily and took the road to the
town, singing in full chorus, and dancing in a grotesque
manner, in derision of their brother-hump of
the castle. He, on his part, without paying farther
attention, went to walk in the fields.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_011" id="i_011"></a>
   <img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="Three Hunchbacks" title="Three Hunchbacks" />
</div>

<p>The lady, who saw her husband cross the bridge,
and had heard the minstrels, called them back to
amuse her. They had not been long returned to the
castle, when her husband knocked at the gate, by
which she and the minstrels were equally alarmed.
Fortunately, the lady perceived in a neighbouring
room three empty coffers. Into each of these she
stuffed a minstrel, shut the covers, and then opened
the gate to her husband. He had only come back
to espy the conduct of his wife as usual, and, after a
short stay, went out anew, at which you may believe
his wife was not dissatisfied. She instantly ran to
the coffers to release her prisoners, for night was approaching
and her husband would not probably be
long absent. But what was her dismay, when she
found them all three suffocated! Lamentation, however,
was useless. The main object now was to get
rid of the dead bodies, and she had not a moment
to lose. She ran then to the gate, and seeing a peasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
go by, she offered him a reward of thirty livres,
and leading him into the castle, she took him to one
of the coffers, and shewing him its contents, told him
he must throw the dead body into the river: he asked
for a sack, put the carcase into it, pitched it over the
bridge, and then returned quite out of breath to claim
the promised reward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_012" id="i_012"></a>
   <img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="Lady hiding three Hunchbacks" title="Lady hiding three Hunchbacks" />
</div>

<p>"I certainly intended to satisfy you," said the lady,
"but you ought first to fulfil the condition of the
bargain&mdash;you have agreed to rid me of the dead body,
have you not? There, however, it is still." Saying
this, she showed him the other coffer in which the
second humpbacked minstrel had expired. At this
sight the clown was perfectly confounded&mdash;"how the
devil! come back! a sorcerer!"&mdash;he then stuffed the
body into the sack and threw it, like the other, over
the bridge, taking care to put the head down and to
observe that it sank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lady had again changed the position
of the coffers, so that the third was now in the place
which had been successively occupied by the two
others. When the peasant returned, she shewed him
the remaining dead body&mdash;"you are right, friend,"
said she, "he must be a magician, for there he is
again." The rustic gnashed his teeth with rage.
"What the devil! am I to do nothing but carry
about this humpback?" He then lifted him up,
with dreadful imprecations, and having tied a stone
round the neck, threw him into the middle of the
current, threatening, if he came out a third time, to
despatch him with a cudgel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_015a" id="i_015a"></a>
   <img src="images/i_015a.jpg" alt="Man carrying Hunchback" title="Man carrying Hunchback" />
</div>

<p>The first object that presented itself to the clown,
on his way back for his reward, was the hunchbacked
master of the castle returning from his evening walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and making towards the gate. At this sight the
peasant could no longer restrain his fury. "Dog of
a humpback, are you there again?" So saying, he
sprung on the Chatelain, threw him over his shoulders,
and hurled him headlong into the river after the
minstrels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/i_015b.jpg" alt="People watching a puppet show" title="People watching a puppet show" />
</div>

<p>"I'll venture a wager you have not seen him this
last time," said the peasant, entering the room where
the lady was seated. She answered, she had not.
"You were not far from it," replied he: "the sorcerer
was already at the gate, but I have taken care of
him&mdash;be at your ease&mdash;he will not come back now."</p>

<p>The lady instantly comprehended what had occurred,
and recompensed the peasant with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>When Charles Gustavus, King of Sweden, was besieging
Prague, a boor, of a most extraordinary
visage, desired admittance to his tent; and being
allowed to enter, he offered, by way of amusement,
to devour a large hog in his presence. The old general
Konigsmark, who stood by the king's side, notwithstanding
his bravery, had not got rid of the prejudices
of his childhood, and hinted to his royal master,
that the peasant ought to be burnt as a sorcerer.
"Sir," said the fellow, irritated at the remark, "if
your majesty will but make that old gentleman take
off his sword and spurs, I will eat him before I begin
the pig." General Konigsmark, who had, at the
head of a body of Swedes, performed wonders against
the Austrians, could not stand this proposal, especially
as it was accompanied by a most hideous expansion
of the jaws and mouth. Without uttering
a word, the veteran turned pale and suddenly ran out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of the tent, and did not think himself safe till he
arrived at his quarters, where he remained above
twenty-four hours, locked securely, before he got rid
of the panic which had so strongly seized him.</p>

<h3>THE HAUNTED PHYSICIANS.</h3>


<p>A lover, whose mistress was dangerously ill, sought
every where for a skilful physician in whom he could
place confidence, and to whose care he might confide
a life so dear to him. In the course of his search he
met with a talisman, by the aid of which spirits might
be rendered visible. The young man exchanged, for
this talisman, half his possessions, and having secured
his treasure, ran with it to the house of a famous
physician. Flocking round the door he beheld a
crowd of shades, the ghosts of those persons whom
this physician had killed. Some old, some young;
some the skeletons of fat old men; some gigantic
frames of gaunt fellows; some little puling infants
and squalling women; all joined in menaces and
threats against the house of the physician&mdash;the den
of their destroyer&mdash;who however peacefully marched
through them with his cane to his chin, and a grave
and solemn air. The same vision presented itself,
more or less, at the house of every physician of eminence.
One at length was pointed out to him in a
distant quarter of the city, at whose door he only perceived
two little ghosts. "Behold," exclaimed he,
with a joyful cry, "the good physician of whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
have been so long in search!" The doctor, astonished,
asked him how he had been able to discover this?
"Pardon me," said the afflicted lover complacently,
"your ability and your reputation are well known to
me." "My reputation!" said the physician, "why I
have been in Paris but eight days, and in that time
I have had but <span class="smcap">two</span> patients." "Good God!" involuntarily
exclaimed the young man, "and there
they are!"</p>

<h3>THE FOUR BLIND BEGGARS.</h3>


<p>There was a man, whose name was Backbac; he was
blind, and his evil destiny reduced him to beg from
door to door. He had been so long accustomed to
walk through the streets alone, that he wanted none
to lead him: he had a custom to knock at people's
doors, and not answer till they opened to him. One
day he knocked thus, and the master of the house,
who was alone, cried, "who is there?" Backbac made
no answer, and knocked a second time: the master of
the house asked again and again, "who is there?" but
to no purpose, no one answered; upon which he came
down, opened the door, and asked the man what he
wanted? "Give me something, for Heaven's sake," said
Backbac; "you seem to be blind," replied the master
of the house; "yes, to my sorrow," answered Backbac.
"Give me your hand," resumed the master of the house;
he did so, thinking he was going to give him alms; but
he only took him by the hand to lead him up to his
chamber. Backbac thought he had been carrying him
to dine with him, as many people had done. When they
reached the chamber, the man let go his hand, and sitting
down, asked him again what he wanted? "I have
already told you," said Backbac, "that I want something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for God's sake." "Good blind man," replied the
master of the house, "all that I can do for you is to
wish that God may restore your sight." "You might
have told me that at the door," replied Backbac, "and
not have given me the trouble to come up stairs." "And
why, fool," said the man of the house, "do not you answer
at first, when people ask you who is there? why
do you give any body the trouble to come and open the
door when they speak to you?"&mdash;"What will you do
with me then?" asked Backbac; "I tell you again,"
said the man of the house, "I have nothing to give
you." "Help me down the stairs then, as you brought
me up."&mdash;"The stairs are before you," said the man of
the house, "and you may go down by yourself if you
will." The blind man attempted to descend, but missing
a step, about the middle of the stairs, fell to the
bottom and hurt his head and his back: he got up
again with much difficulty, and went out, cursing the
master of the house, who laughed at his fall.</p>

<p>As Backbac went out of the house, three blind men,
his companions, were going by, knew him by his voice,
and asked him what was the matter? He told them
what had happened; and afterwards said, "I have
eaten nothing to day; I conjure you to go along with
me to my house, that I may take some of this money
that we four have in common, to buy me something for
supper." The blind men agreed, and they went home
with him.</p>

<p>You must know that the master of the house where
Backbac was so ill used, was a robber, and of a cunning
and malicious disposition; he overheard from his window
what Backbac had said to his companions, and
came down and followed them to Backbac's house.
The blind men being seated, Backbac said to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
"brothers, we must shut the door, and take care there
be no stranger with us." At this the robber was much
perplexed; but perceiving a rope hanging down from a
beam, he caught hold of it, and hung by it while the
blind men shut the door, and felt about the room with
their sticks. When they had done, and had sat down
again in their places, the robber left his rope, and seated
himself softly by Backbac: who, thinking himself
alone with his blind comrades, said to them, "brothers,
since you have trusted me with the money, which we
have been a long time gathering, I will shew you that
I am not unworthy of the confidence you repose in me.
The last time we reckoned, you know that we had ten
thousand dirhems, and that we put them into ten bags:
I will shew you that I have not touched one of them;"
having so said, he put his hand among some old clothes,
and taking out the bags one after another, gave them
to his comrades, saying, "there they are: you may
judge by their weight that they are whole, or you may
tell them if you please." His comrades answered, "there
was no need, they did not mistrust him;" so he opened
one of the bags, and took out ten dirhems, and each of
the other blind men did the like.</p>

<p>Backbac put the bags into their place again; after
which, one of the blind men said to him, "there is
no need to lay out any thing for supper, for I have
collected as much victuals from good people as will
serve us all:" at the same time he took out of his bag
bread and cheese, and some fruit, and putting all upon
the table, they began to eat. The robber, who sat at
Backbac's right hand, picked out the best, and eat
with them; but, whatever care he took to make no
noise, Backbac heard his chaps going, and cried out
immediately, "We are undone, there is a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
among us!" Having so said, he stretched out his
hand, and caught hold of the robber by the arm,
cried out "<i>thieves!</i>" fell upon him, and struck him.
The other blind men fell upon him in like manner;
the robber defended himself as well as he could, and
being young and vigorous, besides having the advantage
of his eyes, he swung by the hanging rope, and
gave furious kicks, sometimes to one, sometimes to
another, and cried out "<i>thieves!</i>" louder than they did.
The neighbours came running at the noise, broke open
the door, and had much ado to separate the combatants;
but having at last succeeded, they asked the
cause of their quarrel. Backbac, who still had hold
of the robber, cried out, "gentlemen, this man I have
hold of is a thief, and stole in with us on purpose to
rob us of the little money we have." The thief, who
shut his eyes as soon as the neighbours came, feigned
himself blind, and exclaimed, "gentlemen, he is a liar.
I swear to you by heavens, and by the life of the
caliph, that I am their companion, and they refuse to
give me my just share. They have all four fallen upon
me, and I demand justice." The neighbours would not
interfere in their quarrel, but carried them all before
the judge. When they came before the magistrate,
the robber, without staying to be examined, cried out,
still feigning to be blind, "sir, since you are deputed
to administer justice by the caliph, whom God prosper,
I declare to you that we are equally criminal, my four
comrades and I; but we have all engaged, upon oath,
to confess nothing except we be bastinadoed; so that
if you would know our crime, you need only order us
to be bastinadoed, and begin with me." Backbac
would have spoken, but was not allowed to do so,
and the robber was put under the bastinado.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_028" id="i_028"></a>
   <img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="Brawl in a household" title="Brawl in a household" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The robber, being under the bastinado, had the
courage to bear twenty or thirty blows: when, pretending
to be overcome with pain, he first opened one
eye, and then the other, and crying out for mercy,
begged the judge would put a stop to the blows.
The judge, perceiving that he looked upon him with
his eyes open, was much surprised, and said to him,
"rogue, what is the meaning of this miracle?" "Sir,"
replied the robber, "I will discover to you an important
secret, if you will pardon me, and give me, as a
pledge that you will keep your word, the seal-ring
which you have on your finger." The judge consented,
gave him his ring, and promised him pardon.
"Under this promise," continued the robber, "I must
confess to you, sir, that I and my four comrades do
all see very well. We feigned ourselves to be blind,
that we might freely enter people's houses, and women's
apartments, where we abuse their weakness.
I must farther confess to you, that by this trick we
have gained together ten thousand dirhems: this day I
demanded of my partners two thousand that belonged
to my share, but they refused, because I told them
I would leave them, and they were afraid I should accuse
them. Upon my pressing still to have my share,
they fell upon me; for which I appeal to those people
who brought us before you. I expect from your justice,
sir, that you will make them deliver me the two
thousand dirhems which are my due; and if you have
a mind that my comrades should confess the truth,
you must order them three times as many blows as I
have had, and you will find they will open their eyes
as well as I have done." Backbac, and the other three
blind men, would have cleared themselves of this horrid
charge, but the judge would not hear them; "villains,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
said he, "do you feign yourselves blind then,
and, under that pretext of moving their compassion,
cheat people, and commit such crimes?" "He is an
impostor," cried Backbac, "and we take God to witness
that none of us can see." All that Backbac could
say was in vain, his comrades and he received each
of them two hundred blows. The judge expected
them to open their eyes, and ascribed to their obstinacy
what really they could not do; all the while
the robber said to the blind men, "<i>Poor fools that you
are, open your eyes, and do not suffer yourselves to be
beaten to death.</i>" Then addressing himself to the judge,
said, "I perceive, sir, that they will be maliciously
obstinate to the last, and will never open their eyes.
They wish certainly to avoid the shame of reading
their own condemnation in the face of every one that
looks upon them; it were better, if you think fit, to
pardon them, and to send some person along with me
for the ten thousand dirhems they have hidden."</p>

<p>The judge consented to give the robber two thousand
dirhems, and kept the rest himself; and as for
Backbac and his three companions, he thought he
shewed them pity by sentencing them only to be banished.</p>

<h3>THE CONSULTATION.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Scene from "Peregrine Pickle."</i></p>


<p>Among those who frequented the pump-room at Bath,
was an old officer, whose temper, naturally impatient,
was, by repeated attacks of the gout, which had almost
deprived him of the use of his limbs, sublimated
into a remarkable degree of virulence and perverseness:
he imputed the inveteracy of his distemper to
the mal-practice of a surgeon who had administered to
him, while he laboured under the consequences of an
unfortunate amour; and this supposition had inspired
him with an insurmountable antipathy to all the professors
of the medical art, which was more and more
confirmed by the information of a friend at London,
who had told him, that it was a common practice
among the physicians at Bath to dissuade their patients
from drinking the water, that the cure, and in
consequence their attendance, might be longer protracted.</p>

<p>Thus prepossessed, he had come to Bath, and, conformable
to a few general instructions he had received,
used the waters without any farther direction, taking
all occasions of manifesting his hatred and contempt
of the sons of Æsculapius, both by speech and gesticulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and even by pursuing a regimen quite contrary
to that which he knew they prescribed to others
who seemed to be exactly in his condition. But he
did not find his account in this method, how successful
soever it may have been in other cases. His complaints,
instead of vanishing, were every day more
and more enraged; and at length he was confined
to his bed, where he lay blaspheming from morn to
night, and from night to morn, though still more determined
than ever to adhere to his former maxims.</p>

<p>In the midst of his torture, which was become the
common joke of the town, being circulated through
the industry of the physicians, who triumphed in his
disaster, Peregrine, by means of Mr. Pipes, employed
a country fellow, who had come to market, to run
with great haste, early one morning, to the lodgings
of all the doctors in town, and desire them to attend
the colonel with all imaginable despatch. In consequence
of this summons, the whole faculty put themselves
in motion; and three of the foremost arriving
at the same instant of time, far from complimenting
one another with the door, each separately essayed to
enter, and the whole triumvirate stuck in the passage;
while they remained thus wedged together, they descried
two of their brethren posting towards the same
goal, with all the speed that God had enabled them to
exert; upon which they came to a parley, and agreed
to stand by one another. This covenant being made,
they disentangled themselves, and, inquiring about the
patient, were told by the servant that he had just fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>Having received this intelligence, they took possession
of his antichamber, and shut the door, while the
rest of the tribe posted themselves on the outside as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
they arrived; so that the whole passage was filled,
from the top of the stair-case to the street-door; and
the people of the house, together with the colonel's servant,
struck dumb with astonishment. The three
leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made their
lodgement good, than they began to consult about
the patient's malady, which every one of them pretended
to have considered with great care and assiduity.
The first who gave his opinion said, the distemper
was an obstinate arthritis; the second affirmed,
that it was no other than a confirmed lues; and the
third swore it was an inveterate scurvy. This diversity
of opinions was supported by a variety of quotations
from medical authors, ancient as well as modern;
but these were not of sufficient authority, or at least
not explicit enough, to decide the dispute; for there
are many schisms in medicine, as well as in religion,
and each set can quote the fathers in support of the
tenets they profess. In short, the contention rose to
such a pitch of clamour, as not only alarmed the
brethren on the stair, but also awaked the patient
from the first nap he had enjoyed in the space of ten
whole days. Had it been simply waking, he would
have been obliged to them for the noise that disturbed
him; for, in that case, he would have been relieved
from the tortures of hell fire, to which, in his dream,
he fancied himself exposed: but this dreadful vision
had been the result of that impression which was
made upon his brain by the intolerable anguish of his
joints; so that when he waked, the pain, instead of
being allayed, was rather aggravated, by a great
acuteness of sensation; and the confused vociferation
in the next room invading his ears at the same time,
he began to think his dream was realized, and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
pangs of despair, applied himself to a bell that stood
by his bedside, which he rung with great violence and
perseverance.</p>

<p>This alarm put an immediate stop to the disputation
of the three doctors, who, upon this notice of his
being awake, rushed into his chamber without ceremony;
and two of them seizing his arms, the third
made the like application to one of his temples. Before
the patient could recollect himself from the amazement
which had laid hold on him at this unexpected
irruption, the room was filled by the rest of the faculty,
who followed the servant that entered in obedience to
his master's call; and the bed was in a moment surrounded
by these gaunt ministers of death. The colonel
seeing himself beset with such an assemblage of
solemn visages and figures, which he had always considered
with the utmost detestation and abhorrence,
was incensed to a most inexpressible degree of indignation;
and so inspirited by his rage, that, though
his tongue denied its office, his other limbs performed
their functions: he disengaged himself from the triumvirate,
who had taken possession of his body,
sprung out of bed with incredible agility, and, seizing
one of his crutches, applied it so effectually to one of
the three, just as he stooped to examine the patient's
water, that his tye-periwig dropped into the pot, while
he himself fell motionless on the floor.</p>

<p>This significant explanation disconcerted the whole
fraternity; every man turned his face, as if it were by
instinct, towards the door; and the retreat of the
community being obstructed by the efforts of individuals,
confusion and tumultuous uproar ensued: for
the colonel, far from limiting his prowess to the first
exploit, handled his weapon with astonishing vigour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and dexterity, without respect of persons; so that
few or none of them had escaped without marks of
his displeasure, when his spirits failed, and he sunk
down again quite exhausted on his bed. Favoured
by this respite, the discomfited faculty collected their
hats and wigs, which had fallen off in the fray; and
perceiving the assailant too much enfeebled to renew
the attack, set up their throats altogether, and loudly
threatened to prosecute him severely for such an outrageous
assault.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_036" id="i_036"></a>
   <img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="Fight in a bed chamber" title="Fight in a bed chamber" />
</div>

<p>By this time the landlord had interposed; and
inquiring into the cause of the disturbance, was informed
of what had happened by the complainants,
who, at the same time, giving him to understand that
they had been severally summoned to attend the colonel
that morning, he assured them, that they had
been imposed upon by some wag, for his lodger had
never dreamed of consulting any one of their profession.</p>

<p>Thunderstruck at this declaration, the general clamour
instantaneously ceased; and each, in particular,
at once comprehending the nature of the joke, they
sneaked silently off with the loss they had sustained,
in unutterable shame and mortification, while Peregrine
and his friend, who took care to be passing that way
by accident, made a full stop at sight of such an extraordinary
efflux, and enjoyed the countenance and
condition of every one as he appeared; nay, even made
up to some of those who seemed most affected with
their situation, and mischievously tormented them with
questions touching this unusual congregation; then,
in consequence of the information they received from
the landlord and the colonel's valet, subjected the
sufferers to the ridicule of all the company in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
As it would have been impossible for the authors of the
farce to keep themselves concealed from the indefatigable
inquiries of the physicians, they made no secret
of their having directed the whole; though they took
care to own it in such an ambiguous manner as afforded
no handle of prosecution.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_VI" id="POINT_VI">POINT VI.</a></h2>

<h3>THE DINNER.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Scene from "Peregrine Pickle."</i></p>


<p>Peregrine, by his insinuating behaviour, acquired
the full confidence of the doctor, who invited him to
an entertainment, which he intended to prepare in the
manner of the ancients. Pickle, struck with this
idea, eagerly embraced the proposal, which he honoured
with many encomiums, as a plan in all respects worthy
of his genius and apprehension; and the day was appointed
at some distance of time, that the treater
might have leisure to compose certain pickles and confections,
which were not to be found among the culinary
preparations of these degenerate days.</p>

<p>With a view of rendering the physician's taste more
conspicuous, and extracting from it more diversion,
Peregrine proposed that some foreigners should partake
of the banquet; and the task being left to his care and
discretion, he actually bespoke the company of a
French marquis, an Italian count, and a German
baron, whom he knew to be most egregious coxcombs,
and therefore more likely to enhance the joy of the
entertainment.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the hour being arrived, he conducted
them to the hotel where the physician lodged, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
having regaled their expectations with an elegant meal
in the genuine old Roman taste; and they were received
by Mr. Pallet, who did the honours of the house,
while his friend superintended the cook below. By this
communicative painter, the guests understood that the
doctor had met with numerous difficulties in the execution
of his design; that no fewer than five cooks had
been dismissed, because they could not prevail upon
their own consciences to obey his directions in things
that were contrary to the present practice of their art;
and that although he had at last engaged a person, by
an extraordinary premium, to comply with his orders,
the fellow was so astonished, mortified, and incensed,
at the commands he had received, that his hair stood
on end, and he begged on his knees to be released from
the agreement he had made; but finding that his employer
insisted upon the performance of his contract,
and threatened to introduce him to the commissaire, if
he should flinch from the bargain, he had, in the discharge
of his office, wept, sung, cursed, and capered,
for two hours without intermission.</p>

<p>While the company listened to this odd information,
by which they were prepossessed with strange notions
of the dinner, their ears were invaded by a piteous
voice, that exclaimed in French, "For the love of God!
dear sir! for the passion of Jesus Christ! spare me the
mortification of the honey and oil!" Their ears still
vibrated with the sound, when the doctor entering, was
by Peregrine made acquainted with the strangers, to
whom he, in the transports of his wrath, could not help
complaining of the want of complaisance he had found
in the Parisian vulgar, by which his plan had been almost
entirely ruined and set aside. The French marquis,
who thought the honour of his nation was concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
at this declaration, professed his sorrow for
what had happened, so contrary to the established
character of the people, and undertook to see the
delinquents severely punished, provided he could be
informed of their names or places of abode. The mutual
compliments that passed on this occasion were
scarce finished, when a servant coming into the room,
announced dinner; and the entertainer led the way into
another apartment, where they found a long table, or
rather two boards joined together, and furnished with a
variety of dishes, the steams of which had such evident
effect upon the nerves of the company, that the marquis
made frightful grimaces, under pretence of taking
snuff; the Italian's eyes watered, the German's visage
underwent several distortions of feature; our hero
found means to exclude the odour from his sense of
smelling, by breathing only through his mouth; and
the poor painter, running into another room, plugged
his nostrils with tobacco. The doctor himself, who
was the only person then present whose organs were
not discomposed, pointing to a couple of couches
placed on each side of the table, told his guests that he
was sorry he could not procure the exact triclinia of the
ancients, which were somewhat different from these
conveniences, and desired they would have the goodness
to repose themselves without ceremony, each in his
respective couchette, while he and his friend Mr. Pallet
would place themselves upright at the ends, that they
might have the pleasure of serving those that lay along.
This disposition, of which the strangers had no previous
idea, disconcerted and perplexed them in a most
ridiculous manner; the marquis and baron stood bowing
to each other, on pretence of disputing the lower
seat, but, in reality, with a view of profiting by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
example of each other: for neither of them understood
the manner in which they were to loll; and Peregrine,
who enjoyed their confusion, handed the count to the
other side, where, with the most mischievous politeness,
he insisted upon his taking possession of the
upper place.</p>

<p>In this disagreeable and ludicrous suspense, they
continued acting a pantomime of gesticulations, until the
doctor earnestly entreated them to wave all compliment
and form, lest the dinner should be spoiled before the
ceremonial could be adjusted. Thus conjured, Peregrine
took the lower couch on the left-hand side, laying
himself gently down, with his face towards the table.
The marquis, in imitation of this pattern, (though he
would have much rather fasted three days than run the
risk of discomposing his dress by such an attitude,)
stretched himself upon the opposite place, reclining
upon his elbow in a most painful and awkward situation,
with his head raised above the end of the couch,
that the economy of his hair might not suffer by the
projection of his body. The Italian, being a thin limber
creature, planted himself next to Pickle, without
sustaining any misfortune, but that of his stocking
being torn by a ragged nail of the seat, as he raised his
legs on a level with the rest of his limbs. But the
baron, who was neither so wieldy nor supple in his joints
as his companions, flounced himself down with such
precipitation, that his feet, suddenly tilting up, came in
furious contact with the head of the marquis, and demolished
every curl in a twinkling, while his own skull,
at the same instant, descended upon the side of his
couch with such violence, that his periwig was struck
off, and the whole room filled with pulvilio.</p>

<p>The drollery of distress that attended this disaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
entirely vanquished the affected gravity of our young
gentleman, who was obliged to suppress his laughter
by cramming his handkerchief into his mouth; for the
bareheaded German asked pardon with such ridiculous
confusion, and the marquis admitted his apology with
such rueful complaisance, as were sufficient to awaken
the mirth of a quietist.</p>

<p>This misfortune being repaired, as well as the circumstances
of the occasion would permit, and every
one settled according to the arrangement already described,
the doctor graciously undertook to give some
account of the dishes as they occurred, that the company
might be directed in their choice; and, with an
air of infinite satisfaction, thus began:&mdash;"This here,
gentlemen, is a boiled goose, served up in a sauce composed
of pepper, lovage, coriander, mint, rue, anchovies,
and oil. I wish for your sakes, gentlemen, it was one
of the geese of Ferrara, so much celebrated among the
ancients for the magnitude of their livers, one of which
is said to have weighed upwards of two pounds; with
this food, exquisite as it was, did the tyrant Heliogabalus
regale his hounds. But I beg pardon, I had
almost forgot the soup, which I hear is so necessary an
article at all tables in France. At each end there are
dishes of the salacacabia of the Romans; one is made
of parsley, pennyroyal, cheese, pine-tops, honey,
vinegar, brine, eggs, cucumbers, onions, and hen livers;
the other is much the same as the soup-maigre of this
country. Then there is a loin of boiled veal with fennel
and carraway seed, on a pottage composed of
pickle, oil, honey, and flour, and a curious hashis of
the lights, liver, and blood of a hare, together with a
dish of roasted pigeons. Monsieur le Baron, shall I
help you to a plate of this soup?" The German, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
did not at all disapprove of the ingredients, assented to
the proposal, and seemed to relish the composition;
while the marquis, being asked by the painter which of
the sillykickabys he chose, was, in consequence of his
desire, accommodated with a portion of the soup-maigre;
and the count, in lieu of spoon meat, of which
he said he was no great admirer, supplied himself with
a pigeon, therein conforming to the choice of our
young gentleman, whose example he determined to
follow through the whole course of the entertainment.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, having swallowed the first spoonful,
made a full pause, his throat swelled as if an egg had
stuck in his gullet, his eyes rolled, and his mouth
underwent a series of involuntary contractions and
dilations. Pallet, who looked steadfastly at this connoisseur,
with a view of consulting his taste, before he
himself would venture upon the soup, began to be
disturbed at these emotions, and observed, with some
concern, that the poor gentleman seemed to be going
into a fit; when Peregrine assured him, that these were
symptoms of ecstacy, and, for further confirmation,
asked the marquis how he found the soup. It was
with infinite difficulty that his complaisance could so
far master his disgust, as to enable him to answer, "altogether
excellent, upon my honour!" and the painter,
being certified of his approbation, lifted the spoon to
his mouth without scruple; but far from justifying the
eulogium of his taster, when this precious composition
diffused itself upon his palate, he seemed to be deprived
of all sense and motion, and sat like the leaden statue
of some river god, with the liquor flowing out at both
sides of his mouth.</p>

<p>The doctor, alarmed at this indecent phenomenon,
earnestly inquired into the cause of it; and when Pallet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
recovered his recollection, and swore that he would
rather swallow porridge made of burning brimstone
than such an infernal mess as that which he had tasted,
the physician, in his own vindication, assured the company,
that, except the usual ingredients, he had mixed
nothing in the soup but some sal ammoniac, instead of
the ancient nitrum, which could not now be procured;
and appealed to the marquis, whether such a succedaneum
was not an improvement on the whole. The
unfortunate petit maître, driven to the extremity of his
condescension, acknowledged it to be a masterly refinement;
and deeming himself obliged, in point of
honour, to evince his sentiments by his practice, forced
a few more mouthfuls of this disagreeable potion down
his throat, till his stomach was so much offended, that
he was compelled to start up of a sudden; and, in the
hurry of his elevation, overturned his plate into the
bosom of the baron. The emergency of his occasions
would not permit him to stay and make apologies for
this abrupt behaviour; so that he flew into another
apartment, where Pickle found him puking, and crossing
himself with great devotion; and a chair, at his
desire, being brought to the door, he slipped into it
more dead than alive, conjuring his friend Pickle to
make his peace with the company, and in particular excuse
him to the baron, on account of the violent fit of
illness with which he had been seized. It was not
without reason that he employed a mediator; for when
our hero returned to the dining-room, the German had
got up, and was under the hands of his own lacquey,
who wiped the grease from a rich embroidered waistcoat,
while he, almost frantic with his misfortune, stamped
upon the ground, and in High Dutch cursed the unlucky
banquet, and the impertinent entertainer, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
all this time, with great deliberation, consoled him for
the disaster, by assuring him, that the damage might be
repaired with some oil of turpentine and a hot iron.
Peregrine, who could scarce refrain from laughing in
his face, appeased his indignation, by telling him how
much the whole company, and especially the marquis,
was mortified at the accident; and the unhappy salacacabia
being removed, the places were filled with two pyes,
one of dormice, liquored with syrup of white poppies,
which the doctor had substituted in the room
of roasted poppy-seed, formerly eaten with honey, as a
dessert; and the other composed of a hock of pork
baked in honey.</p>

<p>Pallet, hearing the first of these dishes described,
lifted up his hands and eyes, and, with signs of loathing
and amazement, pronounced, "A pye made of dormice
and syrup of poppies! Lord in heaven! what
beastly fellows those Romans were!" His friend
checked him for his irreverent exclamation with a severe
look, and recommended the veal, of which he
himself cheerfully ate, with such encomiums to the
company, that the baron resolved to imitate his example,
after having called for a bumper of Burgundy, which
the physician, for his sake, wished to have been the
true wine of Falernum. The painter, seeing nothing
else upon the table which he would venture to touch,
made a merit of necessity, and had recourse to the
veal also; although he could not help saying, that he
would not give one slice of the roast beef of Old
England for all the dainties of a Roman emperor's
table. But all the doctor's invitations and assurances
could not prevail upon his guests to honour the hashis
and the goose; and that course was succeeded by another,
in which he told them there were divers of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
dishes, which, among the ancients, had obtained the
appellation of <i>politeles</i>, or magnificent. "That which
smokes in the middle", said he, "is a sow's stomach,
filled with a composition of minced pork, hog's brains,
eggs, pepper, cloves, garlic, aniseed, rue, ginger, oil,
wine, and pickle. On the right-hand side are the teats
and belly of a sow, just farrowed, fried with sweet
wine, oil, flour, lovage, and pepper. On the left is a
fricassee of snails, fed, or rather purged, with milk.
At that end next Mr. Pallet, are fritters of pompions,
lovage, origanum, and oil; and here are a couple
of pullets, roasted and stuffed in the manner of
Apicius."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="Man dragging a tablecloth from a fully laid table" title="Man dragging a tablecloth from a fully laid table" />
</div>

<p>The painter, who had by wry faces testified his abhorrence
of the sow's stomach, which he compared to
a bagpipe, and the snails which had undergone purgation,
no sooner heard him mention the roasted pullets,
than he eagerly solicited a wing of the fowl; upon
which the doctor desired he would take the trouble of
cutting them up, and accordingly sent them round,
while Mr. Pallet tucked the table-cloth under his chin,
and brandished his knife and fork with singular address;
but scarce were they set down before him, when
the tears ran down his cheeks, and he called aloud, in
manifest disorder,&mdash;"Zounds! this is the essence of a
whole bed of garlic!" That he might not, however,
disappoint or disgrace the entertainer, he applied his
instruments to one of the birds; and, when he opened
up the cavity, was assaulted by such an irruption of
intolerable smells, that, without staying to disengage
himself from the cloth, he sprung away, with an exclamation
of "Lord Jesus!" and involved the whole
table in havoc, ruin, and confusion.</p>

<p>Before Pickle could accomplish his escape, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sauced with a syrup of the dormice pye, which went
to pieces in the general wreck: and as for the Italian
count, he was overwhelmed by the sow's stomach,
which, bursting in the fall, discharged its contents
upon his leg and thigh, and scalded him so miserably,
that he shrieked with anguish, and grinned with a most
ghastly and horrible aspect.</p>

<p>The baron, who sat secure without the vortex of this
tumult, was not at all displeased at seeing his companions
involved in such a calamity as that which he
had already shared; but the doctor was confounded
with shame and vexation. After having prescribed an
application of oil to the count's leg, he expressed his
sorrow for the misadventure, which he openly ascribed
to want of taste and prudence in the painter, who did
not think proper to return, and make an apology in
person; and protested that there was nothing in the
fowls which could give offence to a sensible nose, the
stuffing being a mixture of pepper, lovage, and assaf&#339;tida,
and the sauce consisting of wine and herring-pickle,
which he had used instead of the celebrated
<i>garum</i> of the Romans; that famous pickle having been
prepared sometimes of the <i>scombri</i>, which were a sort
of tunny fish, and sometimes of the <i>silurus</i>, or shad
fish; nay, he observed, that there was a third kind
called <i>garum hæmation</i>, made of the guts, gills, and
blood of the <i>thynnus</i>.</p>

<p>The physician, finding it would be impracticable to
re-establish the order of the banquet, by presenting
again the dishes which had been discomposed, ordered
every thing to be removed, a clean cloth to be laid, and
the dessert to be brought in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he regretted his incapacity to give them
a specimen of the <i>alieus</i>, or fish-meals of the ancients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
such as the <i>jus diabaton</i>, the conger-eel, which, in
Galen's opinion, is hard of digestion; the <i>cornuta</i>, or
gurnard, described by Pliny in his Natural History,
who says, the horns of many were a foot and a half
in length; the mullet and lamprey, that were in the
highest estimation of old, of which last Julius Cæsar
borrowed six thousand for one triumphal supper. He
observed, that the manner of dressing them was described
by Horace, in the account he gives of the entertainment
to which Mæcenas was invited by the
epicure Nasiedenus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Affertur squillas inter muræna natantes, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and told them, that they were commonly eaten with the
<i>thus Syriacum</i>, a certain anodyne and astringent seed,
which qualified the purgative nature of the fish.
Finally, this learned physician gave them to understand,
that, though this was reckoned a luxurious dish
in the zenith of the Roman taste, it was by no means
comparable, in point of expense, to some preparations
in vogue about the time of that absurd voluptuary
Heliogabalus, who ordered the brains of six hundred
ostriches to be compounded in one mess.</p>

<p>By this time the dessert appeared, and the company
were not a little rejoiced to see plain olives in salt and
water: but what the master of the feast valued himself
upon was a sort of jelly, which he affirmed to be preferable
to the <i>hypotrimma</i> of Hesychius, being a mixture
of vinegar, pickle, and honey, boiled to a proper consistence,
and candied assaf&#339;tida, which he asserted,
in contradiction to Aumelbergius and Lister, was no
other than the <i>laser Syriacum</i>, so precious as to be sold
among the ancients to the weight of a silver penny.
The gentlemen took his word for the excellency of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
gum, but contented themselves with the olives, which
gave such an agreeable relish to the wine, that they
seemed very well disposed to console themselves for
the disgraces they had endured; and Pickle, unwilling
to lose the least circumstance of entertainment that
could be enjoyed in their company, went in quest of the
painter, who remained in his penitentials in another
apartment, and could not be persuaded to re-enter the
banqueting-room, until Peregrine undertook to procure
his pardon from those whom he had injured. Having
assured him of this indulgence, our young gentleman
led him in like a criminal, bowing on all hands with an air
of humility and contrition; and particularly addressing
himself to the count, to whom he swore in English, as
God was his Saviour, he had no intent to affront man,
woman, or child; but was fain to make the best of his
way, that he might not give the honourable company
cause of offence, by obeying the dictates of nature in
their presence.</p>

<p>When Pickle interpreted this apology to the Italian,
Pallet was forgiven in very polite terms, and even received
into favour by his friend the doctor, in consequence
of our hero's intercession; so that all the guests
forgot their chagrin, and paid their respects so piously
to the bottle, that, in a short time, the champaign produced
very evident effects in the behaviour of all present.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_VII" id="POINT_VII">POINT VII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE DUEL.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Scene from "Peregrine Pickle."</i></p>


<p>The painter betook himself to the house of the Flemish
Raphael, and the rest of the company went back to
their lodgings; where Peregrine, taking the advantage of
being alone with the physician, recapitulated all the
affronts he had sustained from the painter's petulance,
aggravating every circumstance of the disgrace, and
advising him, in the capacity of a friend, to take care of
his honour, which could not fail to suffer in the opinion
of the world, if he allowed himself to be insulted
with impunity by one so much his inferior in every degree
of consideration.</p>

<p>The physician assured him, that Pallet had hitherto
escaped chastisement, by being deemed an object unworthy
his resentment, and in consideration of the
wretch's family, for which his compassion was interested;
but that repeated injuries would inflame the most
benevolent disposition; and although he could find no
precedent of duelling among the Greeks and Romans,
whom he considered as the patterns of demeanour,
Pallet should no longer avail himself of his veneration
for the ancients, but be punished for the very next
offence he should commit.</p>

<p>Having thus spirited up the doctor to a resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
from which he could not decently swerve, our adventurer
acted the incendiary with the other party also;
giving him to understand, that the physician treated
his character with such contempt, and behaved to him
with such insolence, as no gentleman ought to bear:
that, for his own part, he was every day put out of
countenance by their mutual animosity, which appeared
in nothing but vulgar expressions, more becoming shoe-boys
and oyster-women than men of honour and education;
and therefore he should be obliged, contrary
to his inclination, to break off all correspondence with
them both, if they would not fall upon some method to
retrieve the dignity of their characters.</p>

<p>These representations would have had little effect
upon the timidity of the painter, who was likewise too
much of a Grecian to approve of single combat, in any
other way than that of boxing, an exercise in which he
was well skilled, had they not been accompanied with
an insinuation, that his antagonist was no Hector, and
that he might humble him into any concession, without
running the least personal risk. Animated by this assurance,
our second Rubens set the trumpet of defiance to
his mouth, swore he valued not his life a rush, when his
honour was concerned, and entreated Mr. Pickle to be
the bearer of a challenge, which he would instantly
commit to writing.</p>

<p>The mischievous fomenter highly applauded this
manifestation of courage, by which he was at liberty
to cultivate his friendship and society, but declined the
office of carrying the billet, that his tenderness of Pallet's
reputation might not be misinterpreted into an
officious desire of promoting quarrels. At the same
time he recommended Tom Pipes, not only as a very
proper messenger on this occasion, but also as a trusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
second in the field. The magnanimous painter took
his advice, and, retiring to his chamber, penned a challenge
in these terms.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When I am heartily provoked, I fear not the devil himself;
much less&mdash;&mdash;I will not call you a pedantic coxcomb, nor an unmannerly
fellow, because these are the hippythets of the wulgar: but, remember,
such as you are, I nyther love you nor fear you; but, on the
contrary, expect satisfaction for your audacious behaviour to me on
divers occasions; and will, this evening, in the twilight, meet you on
the ramparts with sword and pistol, where the Lord have mercy on
the soul of one of us, for your body shall find no favour with your
incensed defier, till death.</p>

<p class="signature">
'<span class="smcap">Layman Pallet.</span>'<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This resolute defiance, after having been submitted
to the perusal, and honoured with the approbation of
our youth, was committed to the charge of Pipes, who,
according to his orders, delivered it in the afternoon;
and brought for answer, that the physician would attend
him at the appointed time and place. The challenger
was evidently discomposed at the unexpected
news of this acceptance, and ran about the house in
great disorder, in quest of Peregrine, to beg his further
advice and assistance: but understanding that the
youth was engaged in private with his adversary, he
began to suspect some collusion, and cursed himself
for his folly and precipitation. He even entertained
some thoughts of retracting his invitation, and submitting
to the triumph of his antagonist: but before he
would stoop to this opprobrious condescension, he resolved
to try another expedient, which might be the
means of saving both his character and person. In
this hope he visited Mr. Jolter, and very gravely desired
he would be so good as to undertake the office of his
second in a duel which he was to fight that evening
with the physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor, instead of answering his expectation,
in expressing fear and concern, and breaking forth into
exclamations of, 'Good God! gentlemen! what d'ye
mean? You shall not murder one another while it is
in my power to prevent your purpose. I will go directly
to the governor of the place, who shall interpose
his authority.' I say, instead of these and other friendly
menaces of prevention, Jolter heard the proposal with
the most phlegmatic tranquillity, and excused himself
from accepting the honour intended for him, on account
of his character and situation, which would not permit
him to be concerned in any such rencounters. Indeed
this mortifying reception was owing to a previous hint
from Peregrine, who, dreading some sort of interruption
from his governor, had made him acquainted with
his design, and assured him, that the affair should not
be brought to any dangerous issue.</p>

<p>Thus disappointed, the dejected challenger was overwhelmed
with perplexity and dismay; and, in the terrors
of death or mutilation, resolved to deprecate the wrath
of his enemy, and conform to any submission he should
propose, when he was accidentally encountered by our
adventurer, who, with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction,
told him, in confidence, that his billet had thrown
the doctor into an agony of consternation; that his
acceptance of his challenge was a mere effort of despair,
calculated to confound the ferocity of the sender, and
dispose him to listen to terms of accommodation; that
he had imparted the letter to him, with fear and trembling,
on pretence of engaging him as a second, but, in
reality, with a view of obtaining his good offices in
promoting a reconciliation; 'but perceiving the situation
of his mind,' added our hero, 'I thought it would
be more for your honour to baffle his expectation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
therefore I readily undertook the task of attending him
to the field, in full assurance that he will there humble
himself before you, even to prostration. In this security
you may go and prepare your arms, and bespeak
the assistance of Pipes, who will 'squire you to the field,
while I keep myself up, that our correspondence may
not be suspected by the physician.' Pallet's spirits,
that were sunk to dejection, rose at this encouragement
to all the insolence of triumph; he again declared his
contempt of danger; and his pistols being loaded and
accommodated with new flints, by his trusty armour-bearer,
he waited, without flinching, for the hour of
battle.</p>

<p>On the first approach of twilight, somebody knocked
at his door, and Pipes having opened it at his desire,
he heard the voice of his antagonist pronounce,&mdash;'Tell
Mr. Pallet, that I am going to the place of appointment.'
The painter was not a little surprised at this anticipation,
which so ill agreed with the information he had
received from Pickle; and his concern beginning to recur,
he fortified himself with a large bumper of brandy,
which, however, did not overcome the anxiety of his
thoughts. Nevertheless, he set out on the expedition
with his second, betwixt whom and himself the following
dialogue passed, in their way to the ramparts.&mdash;'Mr.
Pipes,' said the painter, with disordered accent,
'methinks the doctor was in a pestilent hurry with that
message of his.'&mdash;'Ey, ey,' answered Tom, 'I do suppose
he longs to be foul of you.' 'What!' replied the
other,'d'ye think he thirsts after my blood?' 'To be
sure a does,' (said Pipes, thrusting a large quid of tobacco
into his cheek with great deliberation). 'If that
be the case,' cried Pallet, beginning to shake, 'he is
no better than a cannibal, and no Christian ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fight him on equal footing.' Tom observing his emotion,
eyed him with a frown of indignation, saying,
'You an't afraid, are you?' 'God forbid!' replied the
challenger, stammering with fear, 'what should I be
afraid of? the worst he can do is to take my life, and
then he'll be answerable both to God and man for the
murder: don't you think he will?'&mdash;'I think no such
matter,' answered the second: 'if so be as how he
puts a brace of bullets through your bows, and kills
you fairly, it is no more murder than if I was to bring
down a noddy from the main-top-sail-yard.' By this
time Pallet's teeth shattered with such violence, that
he could scarce pronounce this reply.&mdash;'Mr. Thomas,
you seem to make very light of a man's life; but I trust
in the Almighty I shall not be so easily brought down.
Sure many a man has fought a duel without losing his
life. Do you imagine that I run such a hazard of
falling by the hand of my adversary?' 'You may or
you may not,' said the unconcerned Pipes, 'just as it
happens. What then! death is a debt that every man
owes, according to the song; and if you set foot to
foot, I think one of you must go to pot.' 'Foot to
foot!' exclaimed the terrified painter, 'that's downright
butchery; and I'll be damned before I fight any man
on earth in such a barbarous way. What! d'ye take
me to be a savage beast?' This declaration he made
while they ascended the ramparts. His attendant, perceiving
the physician and his second at the distance of
an hundred paces before them, gave him notice of their
appearance, and advised him to make ready, and behave
like a man. Pallet in vain endeavoured to conceal
his panic, which discovered itself in an universal trepidation
of body, and the lamentable tone in which he
answered this exhortation of Pipes, saying,&mdash;'I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
behave like a man; but you would have me act the part
of a brute.&mdash;Are they coming this way?' When Tom told
him that they had faced about, and admonished him to
advance, the nerves of his arm refused their office, he
could not hold out his pistol, and instead of going forward,
retreated with an insensibility of motion; till
Pipes, placing himself in the rear, set his own back to
that of his principal, and swore he should not budge an
inch farther in that direction.</p>

<p>While the valet thus tutored the painter, his master
enjoyed the terrors of the physician, which were more
ridiculous than those of Pallet, because he was more
intent upon disguising them. His declaration to Pickle
in the morning would not suffer him to start any objections
when he received the challenge; and finding that
the young gentleman made no offer of mediating the
affair, but rather congratulated him on the occasion,
when he communicated the painter's billet, all his
efforts consisted in oblique hints, and general reflexions,
upon the absurdity of duelling, which was first
introduced among civilized nations by the barbarous
Huns and Longobards. He likewise pretended to ridicule
the use of fire-arms, which confounded all the
distinctions of skill and address, and deprived a combatant
of the opportunity of signalizing his personal
prowess.</p>

<p>Pickle assented to the justness of his observations;
but, at the same time, represented the necessity of complying
with the customs of this world (ridiculous as
they were), on which a man's honour and reputation
depend. So that, seeing no hopes of profiting by that
artifice, the republican's agitation became more and
more remarkable; and he proposed, in plain terms,
that they should contend in armour, like the combatants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of ancient days; for it was but reasonable, that
they should practise the manner of fighting, since they
adopted the disposition of those iron times.</p>

<p>Nothing could have afforded more diversion to our
hero than the sight of two such duellists cased in iron;
and he wished that he had promoted the quarrel in
Brussels, where he could have hired the armour of
Charles the Fifth, and the valiant Duke of Parma, for
their accommodation; but as there was no possibility
of furnishing them cap-à-pee at Antwerp, he persuaded
him to conform to the modern use of the sword, and
meet the painter on his own terms; and suspecting
that his fear would supply him with other excuses for
declining the combat, he comforted him with some distant
insinuations, to the prejudice of his adversary's
courage, which would, in all probability, evaporate before
any mischief could happen.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this encouragement, he could not
suppress the reluctance with which he went to the
field, and cast many a wishful look over his left shoulder,
to see whether or not his adversary was at his heels.
When, by the advice of his second, he took possession
of the ground, and turned about with his face to the
enemy, it was not so dark, but that Peregrine could
perceive the unusual paleness of his countenance, and
the sweat standing in large drops upon his forehead;
nay, there was a manifest disorder in his speech, when
he regretted his want of the <i>pila</i> and <i>parma</i>, with which
he would have made a rattling noise, to astonish his
foe, in springing forward, and singing the hymn to battle,
in the manner of the ancients.</p>

<p>In the mean time, observing the hesitation of his
antagonist, who, far from advancing, seemed to recoil,
and even struggle with his second, he guessed the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of the painter's thoughts, and collecting all the
manhood that he possessed, seized the opportunity of
profiting by his enemy's consternation. Striking his
sword and pistol together, he advanced in a sort of a
trot, raising a loud howl, in which he repeated, in lieu
of the Spartan song, part of the strophe from one of
Pindar's Pythia, beginning with <i>ek theon gar mekanai
pasai Broteais aretais</i>, &amp;c. This imitation of the Greeks
had all the desired effect upon the painter, who seeing
the physician running towards him like a fury, with a
pistol in his right hand, which was extended, and hearing
the dreadful yell he uttered, and the outlandish
words he produced, was seized with an universal palsy
of his limbs. He would have dropped down upon the
ground, had not Pipes supported and encouraged him
to stand upon his defence. The doctor, contrary to
his expectation, finding that he had not flinched from
the spot, though he had now performed one half of his
career, put in practice the last effort, by firing his pistol,
the noise of which no sooner reached the ears of the
affrighted painter, than he recommended his soul to
God, and roared for mercy with great vociferation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_063" id="i_063"></a>
   <img src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="Duelists attacking one another" title="Duelists attacking one another" />
</div>

<p>The republican, overjoyed at this exclamation, commanded
him to yield, and surrender his arms, on pain
of immediate death; upon which he threw away his
pistols and sword, in spite of all the admonitions and
even threats of his second, who left him to his fate, and
went up to his master, stopping his nose with signs of
loathing and abhorrence.</p>

<p>The victor, having won the <i>spolia opima</i>, granted him
his life, on condition that he would on his knees supplicate
his pardon, acknowledging him inferior to his
conqueror in every virtue and qualification, and promise
for the future to merit his favour by submission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and respect. These insolent terms were readily embraced
by the unfortunate challenger, who fairly owned,
that he was not at all calculated for the purposes of war,
and that henceforth he would contend with no weapon
but his pencil. He begged, with great humility, that
Mr. Pickle would not think the worse of his morals for
this defect of courage, which was a natural infirmity
inherited from his father, and suspend his opinion of
his talents, until he should have an opportunity of contemplating
the charms of his Cleopatra, which would
be finished in less than three months.</p>

<p>Our hero observed, with an affected air of displeasure,
that no man could be justly condemned for being subject
to the impressions of fear; and therefore his cowardice
might easily be forgiven: but there was something
so presumptuous, dishonest, and disingenuous,
in arrogating a quality to which he knew he had not
the smallest pretension, that he could not forget his
misbehaviour all at once, though he would condescend
to communicate with him as formerly, in hopes of seeing
a reformation in his conduct. Pallet protested
that there was no dissimulation in the case: for he was
ignorant of his own weakness, until his resolution was
put to the trial: he faithfully promised to demean himself,
during the remaining part of the tour, with that
conscious modesty and penitence which became a person
in his condition: and, for the present, implored the
assistance of Mr. Pipes, in disembarrassing him from
the disagreeable consequence of his fear.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_VIII" id="POINT_VIII">POINT VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE QUACK DOCTOR.</h3>


<p>The town of Ashbourn, being a great thoroughfare
to Buxton Wells, to the High-peak, and many parts
of the North; and being inhabited by many substantial
people concerned in the mines, and having also
three or four of the greatest horse-fairs in that part of
England, every year; is a very populous town.</p>

<p>There appeared at Ashbourn, for some market-days,
a very extraordinary person, in a character, and with
an equipage, somewhat singular and paradoxical: this
was one Dr. Stubbs, a physician of the itinerant kind.
The doctor came to town on horseback, yet dressed in
a plaid night gown and red velvet cap. He had a small
reading-desk fixed upon the pummel of his saddle, that
supported a large folio, in which, by the help of a monstrous
pair of spectacles, the doctor seemed to read, as
the horse moved slowly on, with a profound attention.
A portmanteau behind him contained his cargo of sovereign
medicines, which, as brick-dust was probably
the principal ingredient, must have been no small burden
to his lean steed.</p>

<p>The 'squire, or assistant, led the doctor's horse slowly
along, in a dress less solemn, but not less remarkable,
than that of his master.</p>

<p>The doctor, from his Rozinante, attended by his
merry-andrew (mounted on a horse-block before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
principal inn), had just begun to harangue the multitude,
and the speech with which he introduced himself
each market-day was to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friends and countrymen! you have frequently
been imposed upon, no doubt, by quacks and ignorant
pretenders to the noble art of physic; who, in order to
gain your attention, have boasted of their many years'
travels into foreign parts, and even the most remote
regions of the habitable globe. One has been physician
to the Sophi of Persia, to the Great Mogul, or the
Empress of Russia; and displayed his skill at Moscow,
Constantinople, Delhi, or Ispahan. Another, perhaps,
has been tooth-drawer to the king of Morocco,
or corn-cutter to the sultan of Egypt, or to the grand
Turk; or has administered a clyster to the queen of
Trebisond, or to Prester John, or the Lord knows who&mdash;as
if the wandering about from place to place (supposing
it to be true) could make a man a jot the wiser.
No, gentlemen, don't be imposed upon by pompous
words and magnificent pretensions. He that goes
abroad a fool will come home a coxcomb.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! I am no High German or unborn doctor&mdash;But
here I am&mdash;your own countryman&mdash;your fellow
subject&mdash;your neighbour, as I may say. Why,
gentlemen, eminent as I am now become, I was born
but at Coventry, where my mother now lives&mdash;Mary
Stubbs by name.</p>

<p>"One thing, indeed, I must boast of, without which
I would not presume to practise the sublime art and
mystery of physic. I am the seventh son of a seventh
son. Seven days was I before I sucked the breast.
Seven months before I was seen to laugh or cry. Seven
years before I was heard to utter seven words; and
twice seven years have I studied, night and day, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the benefit of you, my friends and countrymen: and now
here I am, ready to assist the afflicted, and to cure all
manner of diseases, past, present, and to come; and that
out of pure love to my country and fellow creatures, without
fee or reward&mdash;except a trifling gratuity, the prime
cost of my medicines; or what you may choose voluntarily
to contribute hereafter, out of gratitude for the
great benefit, which, I am convinced, you will receive
from the use of them.</p>

<p>"But come, gentlemen, here is my famous,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Anti-febri-fuge
Tincture; that cures all internal disorders
whatsoever; the whole bottle for one poor shilling.</p>

<p>"Here's my Cataplasma Diabolicum, or my Diabolical
Cataplasm; that will cure all external disorders,
cuts, bruises, contusions, excoriations, and dislocations;
and all for sixpence.</p>

<p>"But here, gentlemen, here's my famous Balsamum
Stubbianum, or Dr. Stubbs's Sovereign Balsam; renowned
over the whole Christian world, as an universal
remedy, which no family ought to be without: it
will keep seven years, and&mdash;be as good as it is now.
Here's this large bottle, gentlemen, for the trifling sum
of eighteen-pence.</p>

<p>"I am aware that your physical gentlemen here
have called me quack, and ignorant pretender, and the
like. But here I am.&mdash;Let Dr. Pestle or Dr. Clyster
come forth. I challenge the whole faculty of the
town of Ashbourn, to appear before this good company,
and dispute with me in seven languages, ancient or modern;
in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew&mdash;in High-Dutch,
French, Italian, or Portuguese. Let them ask me any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
question in Hebrew or Arabic, and then it will appear
who are men of solid learning, and who are quacks and
ignorant pretenders.</p>

<p>"You see, gentlemen, I challenge them to a fair
trial of skill, but not one of them dares show his face;
they confess their ignorance by their silence.</p>

<p>"But come, gentlemen, who buys my elixir Cephalicum,
Asthmaticum, Arthriticum, Diureticum, Emeticum,
Diaphoriticum, Nephriticum, Catharticum.&mdash;Come,
gentlemen, seize the golden opportunity, whilst
health is so cheaply to be purchased."</p>

<p>After having disposed of a few packets, the doctor
told the company, that as this was the last time of his
appearing at Ashbourn (other parts of the kingdom
claiming a part in his patriotic labours), he was determined
to make a present to all those who had been his
patients, of a shilling a-piece. He therefore called upon
all those who could produce any one of Dr. Stubbs's
bottles, pill-boxes, plaisters, or even his hand-bills, to
make their appearance, and partake of his generosity.</p>

<p>This produced no small degree of expectation amongst
those that had been the doctor's customers, who gathered
round him, with their hands stretched out, and
with wishful looks. "Here, gentlemen," says the doctor,
"stand forth! hold up your hands. I promised
to give you a shilling a-piece. I will immediately perform
my promise. Here's my Balsamum Stubbianum;
which I have hitherto sold at eighteen-pence the bottle,
you shall now have it for sixpence."</p>

<p>"Come! gemmen," says the merry-andrew, "where
are you? Be quick! Don't stand in your own light.
You'll never have such another opportunity&mdash;as long
as you live."</p>

<p>The people looked upon each other with an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
disappointment. Some shook their heads, some grinned
at the conceit, and others uttered their execrations&mdash;some
few, however, who had been unwilling to throw
away eighteen-pence upon the experiment, ventured to
give a single sixpence; and the doctor picked up eight or
nine shillings more by this stratagem, which was more
than the intrinsic value of his horse-load of medicines.</p>

</div>

<p>This egregious quack conceiving that he had now
squeezed the last farthing out of his audience, commenced
his retreat from the crowd with his usual solemnity
of deportment, and mock-heroic dignity; when a sly
countryman, who had stood near him for some time,
and had listened with a less than ordinary portion of
credulity, nay, who had, indeed, more than once lifted
up his eyes in token of disbelief, and curved his mouth
into an arch of humourous contempt&mdash;raised a pitchfork
which he had been leaning upon, and urged it into
the posterior of the poor beast, who was condemned to
crawl underneath the Doctor and his baggage.&mdash;This
Rozinante no sooner felt the insidious prick, than, bent
on revenge, she raised her heels with deadly intent;
but in order to raise her heels, the old creature found
it necessary to lower her head, when the Doctor took
that opportunity, which to say the truth, he could not
avoid, of toppling over her shoulders. While the medical
gentleman was performing his somerset in the
air, amidst a shower of his own bottles, to the manifest
delight of the multitude, who shouted and screamed
with joy, and pelted him with stones, and mud, and
filth&mdash;purely out of the extacy of their gratification,
another well disposed patient taking advantage of the
moment, presented a besom to the Merry Andrew, and
fairly swept him from the horse-block, on which he
was capering, among his master's bottles, gallipots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and nostrums, which now bestrewed the pavement.&mdash;After
a few minutes floundering, the faithful pair regained
their legs, and gathering up the remnants of
their trade, retreated to their inn with all convenient
speed, amidst the huzzas and laughter of the mob.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_IX" id="POINT_IX">POINT IX.</a></h2>

<h3>A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Scene from "Les Barons de Felsheim."</i></p>


<p>One evening that those heroes, the Baron of Felsheim
and Brandt, were reclined on their beds, beginning to
drink freely, relating their high feats, and, with becoming
modesty, comparing themselves to nothing less than
an Eugene or a Marlborough, Brandt was on a sudden
struck with a sort of inspiration.&mdash;"We are very comfortable
here," said he to the Baron.&mdash;"Very well indeed,"
replied Ferdinand XV. with a slight symptom of ebriety.&mdash;"No
more guard at night."&mdash;"No longer compelled
to drink water."&mdash;"No more black bread, Colonel."&mdash;"No
more Frenchmen, Brandt, though we beat them
sometimes, eh?"&mdash;"Aye, but with the loss of an eye."&mdash;"And
my poor arm, you have not forgot that?"&mdash;"No
more than I have your leg."&mdash;"My leg, my leg,
ah! that was a sad affair."&mdash;"Your health, Colonel."
"Your's, Brandt."&mdash;"I foresee but one little accident,
my Lord, that can disturb our present felicity."&mdash;"What's
that?"&mdash;"O nothing, a mere trifle.&mdash;I was
thinking that the good Jews of Franckfort may, if they
please, turn the Baron of Felsheim out of his own castle."&mdash;"Faith!
I had forgot those scoundrels;" answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the Baron, drinking a bumper; "however,
you shall go to Franckfort to-morrow morning, collect
the rabble together, and bring them here. I will receive
them in that famous tower, where Witikind, with
only thirty Saxons, stopped, for three days, an army of
one hundred thousand men, led by Charlemagne in person.
The place will inspire them with that veneration
for my person which its shattered state no longer enforces."
"I will go, Colonel."&mdash;"If they are reasonable&mdash;we
will pay them."&mdash;"If they are not&mdash;we must sabre
them."&mdash;"That is well said, Brandt,&mdash;bravo!"&mdash;"Let
us drink, Colonel."&mdash;"With all my heart."&mdash;</p>

<p>The next morning, at break of day, Brandt saddled
his horse, gallopped towards Franckfort, assembled the
Israelites, imparted to them the good intentions of his
master, appointed a day the Colonel would be ready
to receive them, and then returned to the castle.</p>

<p>The punctuality of a good soldier to be at his post
in the hour of battle, of a lover in keeping the first appointment
of his mistress, or of a courtier at the levee,
is not to be compared with the precision of a Jew, who
has money to receive. Those of Franckfort arrived on
the appointed day, at the appointed hour, and long before
the Baron had slept himself sober. Brandt went
to inform him of the arrival of his creditors, assisted
him in putting on a dressing-gown of blue velvet lined
with green stuff, which descended from Ferdinand
XIII. and which Ferdinand XIV. had never worn but
to give his public audiences; tied his sabre over the
said gown, placed his double-barrelled pistols in his
belt, combed his whiskers, and put a white cap over
that of dirty brown, which he commonly wore. The
Baron, thus accoutred, came forth from his bed-chamber,
leaning on his Squire's shoulder; walked majestically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
through two rows, formed by his creditors, and
was followed by them to the tower of Witikind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_077" id="i_077"></a>
   <img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="Baron seated at a table" title="Baron seated at a table" />
</div>

<p>After depositing, on a worm-eaten table, his naked
sword and his pistols, the Baron seated himself in an
immense arm-chair, stroked his whiskers, and spoke in
the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rogues that you are; I have summoned you here
to free myself from your importunities."&mdash;The Jews
made a profound reverence. "I have served the descendant
of Cæsar, who is no better than the descendant
of Witikind:&mdash;but, no matter, I have served him.
I have been in want of money, and have subscribed to
your own terms; now I hold the purse, and dictate in
my turn. I will give you half what I owe you, provided
you sign a receipt for the whole." The Jews
were shocked at this proposal, and were about to expostulate,
but Brandt, giving them a fierce look, imposed
silence, and the Baron repeated his offer. The
creditors shook their heads, in token of discontent.
Ferdinand XV. swore, by his ancestors, that he would
cause all the bailiffs, who should dare to approach his
castle, to be thrown into the ditch, and Brandt swore,
by Prince Eugene, that he would immediately treat
the Saxon Jews, as the Arabian Jews had treated the
Amalekites, if they did not agree to a compromise; on
saying which, he brandished his sabre over the heads
of the Israelites, who continued, however, unintimidated.
A Jew has no fear for his head, when he trembles
for his money.</p>

<p>The Baron began to be uneasy, swore between his
teeth, and was a little embarrassed, when Brandt, who
loved gentle means as well as any body, when he found
nothing else would succeed, advised the Colonel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
leave the room, took up the pistols, went out himself
by a postern door, threatened to blow out the brains of
the first who should dare to move, and shut up the Israelites
in the tower.</p>

<p>Although they passed a great part of the day without
food, they still continued obstinate. At length their
physical thirst equalled their thirst for gold, and they
endeavoured to move the iron bars, which Ferdinand
XI. had fixed to the windows. The relentless Brandt,
who was armed with a double-barrelled gun, and who
kept a sharp look-out, opposed himself so warmly to
their attempt that they were obliged to abandon it.
They then asked for quarter, but Brandt's only reply
was, "Will you take the half of your money?" The
Jews signified their dissent by withdrawing from the
window.</p>

<p>When night approached, Brandt, fearing to be surprised,
lighted a fire at the foot of the tower, and he
and the Jews spent the hours in watching each other's
motions. The next morning, the prisoners began to
feel the cravings of nature, and one of them demanded
a parley. "Will you have half?" was again the demand
of the inflexible Brandt. "We will take two thirds,"
said a voice. Brandt pretended not to hear it, and continued
to walk to and fro, with his musket on his shoulder.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, the Jews, no longer able to resist
the hunger which tormented them, requested another
conference; and, with seeming reluctance, agreed to
take the half of their debt. "You shall have but one
third," replied Brandt; "and, if you do not capitulate
instantly, you shall have nothing." About four, a Jew,
almost fainting, said, "Give us the half."&mdash;"You shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
have but a quarter," said Brandt. "Well, let us conclude
for a quarter," replied the Israelite: "there are
Christians possessed of less mercy than Jews."</p>

<p>Brandt ran immediately to fetch some paper and a
small ink-stand, tied the whole at the end of a long
pole, which he presented to the prisoners, and ordered
them to give a receipt for three parts of the
debt, which was executed instantly, and he received
it back by the same conveyance. He carried this
valuable acquisition to the Baron, from whom he
received a small bag of imperial florins, came back to
the tower, paid the remaining quarter, and was particularly
careful in obtaining the title-deeds. He then
conducted the Jews to the door, with great civility,
and they departed, wishing him most heartily at the
devil.</p>

<p>By way of rejoicing, for the very economical manner
in which the Baron had discharged his debts,
Brandt placed upon the table a large piece of smoked
bacon, and an old cock roasted; and it was agreed,
for once, that they should begin to drink at five o'clock,
even at the risk of not finding their way to bed until
the next morning.</p>

<p><i>Gow.</i> Nay, that's right: but why wear you your
leek to day? St. David's day is past.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
in all things; I will tell you as a friend, Captain
Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggarly, lowsie, pragging
knave Pistol, which you and yourself and all the
world know to be no petter than a fellow (look you
now) of no merits; he is come to me and prings me
pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my
leek. It was in a place where I could breed no contentions
with him; but I will be so pold as to wear it
in my cap, till I see him once again; and then I will
tell him a little piece of my desires.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Pistol.</i></p>

<p><i>Gow.</i> Why, here he comes, swelling like a Turky-cock.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> 'Tis no matter for his swelling, nor his Turky-cocks.

[<i>Strikes him</i>] You call'd me yesterday, Mountain-Squire,
but I will make you to day a Squire of low degree. I
pray you, fall to; if you can mock a leek, you can eat

<p><i>Gow.</i> Enough, captain; you have astonish'd him.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek,
or I will peat his pate four days and four nights. Pite,

will you mock at an antient tradition, began upon an
honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy

and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You
